# Unity Game Project: Plants vs Zombies Clone

Welcome to my Unity game project! This is a simple 2D tower defense game inspired by the popular Plants vs Zombies series. As a beginner in game development, this project is my attempt to recreate the fun and engaging gameplay of the original while learning the fundamentals of game design and development.

## Project Overview

This project is a 2D tower defense game built using the Unity game engine with the built-in rendering pipeline. It is designed for Windows 64-bit standalone platforms and utilizes the Legacy Input Manager for handling player inputs. The game features basic mechanics, colorful visuals, and simple animations, providing an enjoyable experience while showcasing my progress as a new game developer.

## Game Description

In this game, players defend their base from waves of enemies by strategically placing defensive units (plants) on a grid-based battlefield. Each plant has unique abilities, and players must manage their resources wisely to fend off the advancing enemies. The game combines strategy, resource management, and quick decision-making to create an engaging and challenging experience.

### Key Features

- <b>Tower Defense Gameplay</b>: Players place defensive units (plants) on a grid to stop waves of enemies from reaching their base.
- <b>Variety of Units</b>: The game includes different types of plants, each with unique abilities and strengths.
- <b>Resource Management</b>: Players must collect resources to place new plants and upgrade existing ones.
- <b>Wave System</b>: Enemies attack in waves, with each wave becoming progressively more challenging.
- <b>2D Graphics</b>: The game is built using Unity's 2D tools, including 2D Animation, 2D Enhancers, and 2D Tilemap, to create a visually appealing and interactive environment.
- <b>Pixel-Perfect Graphics</b>: The 2D Pixel Perfect package ensures crisp and clear visuals for a retro-inspired aesthetic.
- <b>Character Animation</b>: The game includes animated plants and enemies, created using Unity's 2D Animation tools.
- <b>Cinematic Sequences</b>: The Unity Timeline package is utilized to create engaging cutscenes and transitions between levels.

## How to Play

1. <b>Objective</b>: Defend your base by strategically placing plants to stop waves of enemies.
2. <b>Controls</b>: Use the mouse to select and place plants on the grid. Collect resources to deploy more plants and upgrades.
3. <b>Levels</b>: Progress through multiple levels, each with unique challenges and increasing difficulty.
